    config UI_USE_LVGL_MUSIC_DEMO
        bool "Use LVGL Music Demo for Music Player Screen"
        default n
        depends on LV_USE_DEMO_MUSIC
        help
            When enabled, the Music Player screen will use the official LVGL Music Demo
            (lv_demo_music) instead of the custom UI implementation.
            
            This requires LV_USE_DEMO_MUSIC to be enabled in LVGL configuration.

    config SX_UI_THEME_DEFAULT
        string "Default Theme"
        default "dark"
        help
            Default UI theme (dark, light, auto).
            Can be changed at runtime via Settings service.

    config SX_UI_ANIMATION_ENABLE
        bool "Enable UI Animations"
        default y
        help
            Enable UI animations and transitions.
            Disable to reduce CPU usage.

    config SX_ENABLE_UI_THREAD_ASSERT
        bool "Enable UI Thread Runtime Assert (P1.1)"
        default y
        help
            Enable runtime assertion to verify LVGL calls are only made from UI task.
            This is a MUST requirement in SIMPLEXL_ARCH v1.3 Section 7.3.
            
            When enabled, SX_ASSERT_UI_THREAD() will check if LVGL calls are made
            from the correct task. If a call is made from a non-UI task, it will
            log an error and assert (in debug builds).
            
            Disable only for production builds where assert overhead is not acceptable.
            However, it is recommended to keep enabled even in production for safety.
